           Arsenal Legends in their own right

            Many players have worn the cannon on their chest, but some have been more special than others.  Lets review some of the greatest AFC players in recent memory.

            <h2>
                <b>Ian Wright</b>
            </h2>
            <p>
                A prolific score in his own right tallying 128 goals in his 221 appearances.  Ian ushered in a new era of Arsenal football when he joined in 1991 
                after their previous title winning side in 1989.  His contributions to glory also included a Premiere League title in the 1997/1998 campaign and an FA Cup in in 1993 and 2002.

                <b>Dennis Bergkamp</b>
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Flying Dutchman perhaps did not live up to his name properly as he has sworn off ever flying in a plane again!  But his outstretched touch to secure a win is some of the
                most sublime footballing you will ever see.  He had 87 goals and 94 assists to his record while appearing in 315 matched across all competitions from 1995 to 2006.  One of the 
                Invincibles, the 2003-2004 side that did not lose a single match on their way to the Premiere League title.  This coupled 2 more PL titles and 3 FA Cup winners medals makes him
                one of the most decorated players to ever wear an Arsenal shirt.

            <h2>
                <b>Tony Adams</b>
            </h2>
            <p>
               "Mr. Arsenal" Tony Adams had an astounding 20 year career with Arsenal.  Making his debut at the age of 17 in 1983 and retiring after the 2001-2002 season, he was a stalwart
               on the backline.  Arsenal through and through and one the last of the old legends before Arsene Wenger changed the game and put an end to nights out at the pub before a match.
               Another of the most decorated Arsenal players, he won the league 4 times and added 3 FA Cups to his trophy cabinet as well.

            <h2>
                <b>Sol Campbell</b>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Perhaps most famous for his shock transfer to Arsenal while he was the Tottenham Hotspur captain.  Sol was a menacing center back that also featured prominently in the Invincibles side.
                Although his time at Arsenal was short, playing only from 2001-2006 with a short stint in 2010 during an all too regular injury crisis at the club, Sol played 144 matched total
                for the Arsenal.  He claims two league and FA Cup titles apiece.

            <h2>
                <b>Aaron Ramsey</b>
            </h2>
            <p>
               The most recent Arsenal player on this list, Aaron made his debut for the club at 18 in 2008 until he left on a free transer to Juventus in 2019.  Most noted for his horific leg 
               injury suffered at the hands of the orcs at Stoke City, Ramsey over came adversity to become a club favorit.  When he was finally health, he led the Arsenal team to their first
               trophy in 10 years when they won the FA Cup in 2014.  The box to box midfielder put in a shift all over the pitch tallying 40 goals and 46 assists in 262 matches.  Ramsey has also
               been called a Death Merchant , as many of his goals have coincided with the passing a several celebrities such as Osama bin Laden, Steve Jobs, Muammar Gaddafi, Whitney Houston,
               Robin Williams, David Bowie, Alan Rickman, Gregg Allman, and Stephen Hawking.

            <h2>
                <b>Thierry Henry</b>
            </h2>
            <p>
              The GOAT.  Thierry Henry is the greatest to ever play in the Premiere League and his stats back up that claim.  Not only did he rack up a jaw dropping 174 goals in 254 matches,
              he also contributed 74 assists including 20 in the 2002-2003 season, still a Premiere League record.  Oh, I forgot to mention he was a striker and also contributed 24 goals that
              season.  Henry's Arsenal career spanned from 1999 to 2007 and he also made a brief reappearance in 2012 after another injury crisis in the squad.  Another member of the Invicibles,
              Henry lays 2 Premiere League and 2 FA Cup titles to his claim.  The man refused to lose and is perhaps most famous for telling the opposing Tottenham players that Arsenal will
              win the league on their pitch, which they did.
